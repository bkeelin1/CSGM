Description: The CSGM package streamlines the arduous exploratory and inferential 
    data analyses involved in both studies of biomechanical geometry and
    geometric morphometrics of bone cross-sections. This package has several 
    functions to evaluate the potential relationships between the biomechanical
    properties of bone and its overall shape from multiple whole or subsetted 
    bone comparisons. This package utilizes a nested modelling approach to 
    conduct several dataset comparisons in parallel and generate meaningful
    plot visualizations and statistical results. This package is designed to 
    allow users to test multiple hypotheses or models involving multiple data 
    types.
