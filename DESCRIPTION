Description: The CSGM package was designed to streamline the data analysis pipeline
    when evaluating multiple models involving complex, multivariate shape and 
    biomechanical data in parallel including the generation of interactive plots
    using the plotly package. This package was designed to allow users to, in
    parallel, test multiple hypotheses or models involving multiple data types.
