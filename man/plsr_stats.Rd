\description{
A function designed to compute comprehensive performance statistics from partial least
squares (PLS) model objects through cross-validation procedures. This function serves
as an internal model assessment tool within Bio.VIP, calculating various measures of
fit and predictive ability including R2, Q2, and RMSEP. It handles different PLS model
types (spls, plsr2, mvr) and implements permutation testing for statistical significance.
}
\details{
The plsr_stats function provides a unified approach to assessing PLS model performance
across different PLS implementations. For each model type, it computes both model fit
and predictive ability statistics through cross-validation procedures.

The function first determines the PLS model type (spls, plsr2, or mvr) and adapts its
calculations accordingly. For sparse PLS (spls), it uses the mixOmics framework for
cross-validation. For plsr2 and mvr models, it implements custom cross-validation
procedures.

Cross-validation is performed using either k-fold or leave-one-out methods. For k-fold
cross-validation, multiple repeats are performed to ensure stable estimates. During
cross-validation, the function:
\enumerate{
\item Splits data into training and test sets
\item Fits PLS model on training data
\item Predicts test set responses
\item Calculates performance metrics
}

The function calculates several key statistics:
\itemize{
\item R2: Measures model fit as proportion of variance explained
\item Q2: Cross-validated R2, indicates predictive ability
\item RMSEP: Measures prediction error in original response units
}

Statistical significance is assessed through permutation testing. The function:
\enumerate{
\item Randomly permutes response values
\item Recalculates performance metrics
\item Compares observed statistics to null distribution
\item Calculates p-values
}

The function implements adaptive convergence checking for permutation tests to optimize
computational efficiency while maintaining statistical rigor.
