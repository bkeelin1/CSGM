\usage{
cn(
  matrix,
  g1name = "Group 1",
  g2name = "Group 2",
  title = "Correlation Network Plot Comparison",
  threshold = 0.6,
  colors = c("orange", "royalblue"),
  res = 600,
  width = 10,
  height = 8
)
}
\arguments{
\item{matrix}{A numeric matrix where rows represent variables in Group 1 and
columns represent variables in Group 2.}

\item{g1name}{A character string. The label for the first group (rows). Defaults to "Group 1".}

\item{g2name}{A character string. The label for the second group (columns). Defaults to "Group 2".}

\item{title}{A character string. The main title of the plot. Defaults to
'Correlation Network Plot Comparison'.}

\item{threshold}{A numeric value. The absolute correlation coefficient cutoff.
Edges with weights below this value are excluded. If the threshold is higher
than the maximum observed correlation, it is automatically lowered to the maximum.
Defaults to 0.7.}

\item{colors}{A character vector of length 2. Hex codes or names for the node
colors (Group 1, Group 2). Defaults to c("#FF8C00", "#1E90FF").}

\item{res}{Numeric. The resolution (DPI) for the saved PNG. Defaults to 600.}

\item{width}{Numeric. The width of the saved image in inches. Defaults to 10.}

\item{height}{Numeric. The height of the saved image in inches. Defaults to 8.}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot} object representing the network graph.
}
\description{
This function generates a network visualization of correlations between two groups
of variables (rows and columns of the input matrix). It automatically filters
weak correlations, adjusts visual parameters based on network density, and saves
a high-resolution PNG image.

Saves a PNG file to the working directory with the naming convention:
\code{Cor_Network_[Group1]_vs_[Group2].png}.
