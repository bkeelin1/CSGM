\description{
AABA is an umbrella function used to analyze relationships between multivariate
and multidimensional data. This function takes a model-based hypothesis
approach to conduct multiple tests to evaluate one or more hypothesis models
related to integration, correlation, covariation, classification, and/or prediction.
Data can be subsetted and transformed using the \code{DT} function (see details).
AABA has the ability to conduct three subsequent series of analyses: (1)
correlation via \code{cor.bio}, (2) covariation/integration via \code{pls.bio},
and (3) multivariate prediction or classification via \code{pred}.
}
\details{
AABA integrates multiple statistical approaches to provide a comprehensive analysis
of relationships between multivariate datasets. The function processes each hypothesis
model sequentially through up to four analytical stages, depending on the enabled options.
Multiple tests of subsetted data for a single test within a hypothesis model
is also supported through the point_set parameter, enabling investigation of
specific variable combinations or anatomical regions. When paired_subsets=TRUE,
all possible combinations of response and predictor subsets are analyzed,
providing a comprehensive view of relationships between data sets.

When cors = TRUE, several correlation and integration statistics will be estimated
to evaluate the associations between multivariate data sets via via \code{cor.bio}.
If the multivariate data sets structures are identical, a permuted Mantel test
is conducted, otherwise canonical correlation analysis is performed. Correlograms
of correlation matrices are generated as an output to visualize variable associations.
See \code{\link{cor.bio}} for more details.

When vips = TRUE, a user specified partial least squares (PLS) and variable importance
in projection (VIP) analysis is performed for each test within each hypothesis model,
This part of the function also generates summary statistics from the PLS analyses
as well as VIP plots to assess variable importance when vip_plots = TRUE.
See \code{\link{pls.bio}} for more details.

When covs = TRUE, a shape specific two-block PLS (2B-PLS) covariation analysis
is conducted and subsequently will generate interactive .html files in a user
specified directory to view the major shape changes associated with each latent
variable using the \code{lolshape} function. See \code{\link{pls.bio}} for more details.

When regs = TRUE, the function will conduct a permuted, cross-validated, and/or
bootstrapped prediction or classification regression via the \code{reg.bio} function.
This function, like the others, permits for both data subsetting as well offers
different methods to test for statistical significance using a flexible
Randomized Residual Permutation Procedure (RRPP) which has been adapted for
multivariate data. See \code{\link{reg.bio}} for more details.

When PSLR = TRUE, a Procrustes Shape Linear Regression (PSLR) is performed via
the \code{pslr.bio} function. This function specifically handles landmark data as
response (dependent) data, conducting shape regression analysis while
preserving geometric relationships. See \code{\link{pslr.bio}} for more details.

Data transformation can be parameterized through dt_parameters within the Models
structure as the third object within a test within a hypothesis model or
through arguments passed via the argument (...). These parameters modify how
data is processed before each analytical stage, allowing flexibility in
handling different data types.
