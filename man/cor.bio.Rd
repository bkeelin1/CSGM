\description{
cor.bio is a function designed to investigate, in parallel, relationships between sets
of multivariate data through several permuted correlation tests. This function uses a
model-based hypothesis testing structure where a \code{Models} nested list object
contains hypothesis tests which usually involve one or more correlation test sets
of data. Data can be both subsetted and transformed using the \code{DT} function
(see details). The function calculates correlation coefficients and generates
correlograms to visualize dataset relationships as well as conducts either
Mantel tests (for same data structures) or canonical correlation tests (for
different data structures). This function also output correlation summary statistics
which can be useful for contexts of integration.
}
\details{
cor.bio conducts correlation analyses in parallel for each test within a hypothesis
model using both correlation coefficient matrices. For each test within a
hypothesis model, the function first performs user-specified data transformations
via the \code{DT} function parameters. If no parameters additional DT related
parameters are provided through argument (...), the function proceeds with
the raw data. When geometric morphometric data is supplied in "p x k x n"
(landmarks, dimensions, observations) array format, the function automatically
converts the data to a data frame while preserving spatial relationships.

The function implements a two-stage correlation analysis approach. First, it calculates
standard Pearson correlation coefficients between all variables, generating a complete
correlation matrix with associated p-values for significance testing. These correlations
are visualized through correlograms generated using the \pkg{corrplot} package, with
significant correlations (p < 0.05) distinctly marked. Second, the function conducts
either a permuted Mantel test for same structured data or a permuted canonical correlation tests
with 1000 permutations to assess matrix-wide correlations. The function outputs
a correlation statistic (r) and significance value (p), along with overall (I) and
intradata (I_x, I_y) correlation measures.

When point_set is provided, the function performs separate correlation analyses
sequentially for each defined subset. The function automatically performs two separate
tests in subsetted cases: (1) a complete analysis without subsets (Cor.All.Mantels),
(2) a series of paired subset analysis (Cor.subset.Mantels). Additionally,
the joint data correlation matrices are also output by the function for the
same subset comparison (same.subsets) and a trimmed matrix of variables where r >= 0.7
(trim.same.subsets) as well as a paired subset comparison matrix (pair.subsets)
and a trimmed matrix of variables where r >= 0.7 (trim.dif.subsets).

The function generates several output files stored in an organized directory structure.
Correlograms are automatically saved as high-resolution PNG files, named according
to the model and test structure. For subset analyses, separate plots are generated
for each subset or subset combination. Statistical results are stored in the returned
list object, organized hierarchically to match the input model structure.

For geometric morphometric data, cor.bio first transforms the data. If no data
transformation is selected, the data will be transformed as a "n x p" matrix and
subject to principal component analysis. This ensures that shape information is
appropriately considered in the correlation calculations. All other data types
will first be subject to a user-specified data transformation using the \code{DT}
function parameters via the argument (...) or as the third object of each hypothesis
model test in the Models argument. If no \code{DT} function parameters are
provided, no data transformation will occur prior to correlation analysis.
The function automatically detects landmark data based on array dimensionality
and adjusts its procedures accordingly.
