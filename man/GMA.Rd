\arguments{
\item{Landmarks}{Either a 2D array (p x k x n) (landmarks, dimensions, observations),
3D array (p x k x n), n x p data.frame, n x p data matrix, p x k data.frame
(also tbl.df or tbl) object. Data should be the original landmark configuration
prior to any Procrustes Superimposition or data transformation.}

\item{k}{number of dimensions of the landmark data}

\item{ID}{An optional vector or data.frame column indicating a string of names
for each specimen within your dataset. This will be used as tip labels for
hierarchical clustering as well as in PCA shape visualizations. Default is
set to NULL.}

\item{Group}{Optional data.frame or list indicating the grouping variable(s)
the user wants to include for each specimen in the dataset, array, or object.
This variable will be used in principal component visualizations. Default is
set to NULL.}

\item{coord_name}{Optional vector or data.frame column containing the names
of each landmark and semilandmark in the configuration}

\item{subset}{An optional group vector which indicates if there are
subdivisions in the landmark configuration. This will be used to generate
extreme shape graphics using plotly to toggle different landmark configuration
groups. This vector should only name the landmark number by their respective
group and not of their specific axes coordinates (x,y,z).}

\item{phy}{A phylogenetic tree of class \emph{phylo}. This tree will be used to
tailor PCA configuration and weight specimen shape variation by their
phylogenetic relationships. Default is set to NULL.}

\item{bilat_sym}{A logical TRUE/FALSE statement indicating whether or not the
user desires an analysis of bilateral symmetry to conduct tests to evaluate
the degree which shape variation is influenced by factors of directional and/or
fluctuating asymmetry. If this argument is set to TRUE, user must add additional
parameters required by the \code{\link{bilat.symmetry}} function from the
\pkg{geomorph} package. Particularly relevant is the arguments "side", "replicate",
and "object.sym". See \code{\link{bilat.symmetry}} for more details.}

\item{w_morpho_pca}{A logical TRUE/FALSE statement to indicate whether a
permutated hierarchical cluster analysis should be performed and subsequently
applied as an apriori weighting of individuals based on morphological shape
dissimilarity in a principal component analysis. Default is set to FALSE.}

\item{pca_centering}{character ("OLS", "OLS+align", "GLS", "GLS+align")
selecting which method of centering technique the user would prefer a principal
component analysis should center the Procrustes landmark (and/or Procrustes residuals)
configurations. The options are through Ordinary Least Squares (OLS; a common
approach assuming equal variances and weighting all landmarks equally), General
Least Squares (GLS; an approach assuming unequal variances and weighting
landmarks with little variance much greater than those with larger variances),
OLS centering with alignment of the PCA by the phylogeny or morphometric
cluster, or GLS centering with alignment of the PCA by the phylogeny or
morphometric cluster. When a phylogeny is absent and w_morpho_pca is set to
default (= NULL), alignment or GLS centering makes little sense and subsequently
will result in an error. Default option is set to "OLS".}

\item{key}{Character string. Identifier for output files and directories. Default is NULL.}

\item{print_progress}{An logical value indicating whether the function should
generate a progress bar in the Console with updates on the function process.}

\item{...}{Any additional arguments from the \code{bilat.symmetry}, \code{gpagen},
\code{Hullgen}, or \code{CAV} functions from \pkg{CSGM} and \pkg{geomorph}
can be passed through here.}

\item{residual_test}{Logical TRUE/FALSE statement indicating whether user
desires to have Procrustes residuals calculated to be separately performed on
tests and PCA. Default is set to FALSE.}

\item{method}{a character string indicating the distance matrix method that
should be applied on the data when w_morpho_pca = TRUE. Options include: "manhattan",
"euclidean", "canberra", "clark", "bray", "kulczynski", "jaccard", "gower",
"altGower", "morisita", "horn", "mountford", "raup", "binomial", "chao", "cao",
"mahalanobis", "chisq", "chord", "hellinger", "aitchison", or "robust.aitchison".
Please see the \emph{vegdist} "method" argument from the \strong{vegan} package for more
details.}

\item{curves}{An optional curve matrix via the \code{gen_curves} function to
ensure equidistant semilandmark points.}

\item{side}{An optional vector which EITHER indicates which individuals
represent the left and right sides OR indicates which landmarks in the
configuration represents the left and right sides. Only necessary when
argument 'bilat_sym = TRUE' and the type of symmetry is set to "matching".
Default is set to NULL. Please see the function \code{bilat.symmetry} from
the \pkg{geomorph} package for more information.}

\item{replicate}{An optional vector which indicates which specimens in the
sample are replicates of each other. Only necessary when argument
'bilat_sym = TRUE' AND the type of symmetry is set to "matching". Default is
set to NULL. Please see the function \code{bilat.symmetry} from the \pkg{geomorph}
package for more information.}

\item{parallel}{Logical value indicating whether to use parallel processing}

\description{
This functions provides a way to conduct a geometric
morphometric analysis and produce both informative results and graphic
visualizations with a single function. This function flexibly takes a wide
range of landmark configurations and subjects it to a Generalized Procrustes
Analysis (GPA). Additionally, this function can perform an analysis of bilateral
symmetry, permuted agglomerative or K-Medoids cluster analysis to view individual
relationships, and a weighted or unweighted principal component analysis. This
function's greatest strength is in its flexibility as well as new interactive
graphics to visualize shape relationships leveraging the \pkg{\link{plotly}} package.

\itemize{\strong{GMA can perform the following:}
\item{Generalized Procrustes Analysis}
\item{bilateral (as)symmetry test with visualizations}
\item{agglomerative and K-Medoids cluster analysis with graphics}
\item{Test for overall allometric influence on shape and outlier analysis}
\item{phylogenetically and/or morphometrically weighted Principal
Component Analysis}
\item{Principal Component plots and extreme shape visualizations}
}

\details{
GMA takes a landmark configuration and conducts a thorough geometric morphometric
analysis which includes Generalized Procrustes Analysis (GPA), bilateral symmetry
analysis, an interactive Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and an optional
unsupervised K-Medoids and Agglomerative Hierarchcical cluster analysis. This
function was designed to allow a user to quick and efficient way to conduct an
exploratory data analysis with shape data and provides interactive graphics
useful for subsequent down-stream analyses.

This function accepts a few standard input data formats for the argument Landmarks,
including a \link{p x k x n} 2D or 3D array, an \link{n x p} data frame or matrix, a
\link{p x k} data frame or matrix, as well as table objects of the same dimensions.
Data should be the original landmark configuration prior to any data transformation.
Landmark configurations are subjected to Generalized Procrustes Analysis (GPA)
using the \code{gpagen} from the \pkg{geomorph} package. The argument (...)
allows the user to add in additional arguments which can be passed to \code{gpagen}.
When semilandmarks are present and a curves matrix are provided, the function
implements sliding semilandmark procedures to minimize bending energy and provide
a more improved overall fit.

For bilateral structures, the function implements comprehensive symmetry analysis through
either matching symmetry (comparing separate structures) or object symmetry (analyzing
symmetric structures). This analysis decomposes shape variation into symmetric and
asymmetric components, enabling investigation of both directional and fluctuating
asymmetry. This function takes the approach following Lazic et al. (2008) and
additionally provides mantel significance tests to evaluate whether the same
factors are influencing the symmetric and asymmetric shape variation on the
left and right sides.

Morphological clustering is performed through \code{CAV}, which implements both supervised
agglomerative hierarchical clustering and unsupervised k-medoids clustering. The
agglomerative clustering method is automatically selected based on the highest
agglomerative coefficient among available methods (average, single, complete, ward,
weighted). For k-medoids clustering, the optimal number of clusters is determined
through silhouette width analysis (see \code{\link{PMA}} and \code{\link{pvclust}}
for more details on how each analysis is performed). Landmarks are transformed
to Mahalanobis distances with parallel processing. Additional arguments can be passed
to CAV. See \code{\link{CAV}} for more details on argument names and choices.

Principal Component Analysis is conducted using either standard or phylogenetically/
morphometrically weighted approaches. The function determines significant PCs through
a principal component based factor analysis via \code{fa.parallel}. For visualizations,
the function generates several interactive plots using the workhorse package
\pkg{\link{plotly}}.

\itemize{Generated Plots include:
\item{2D and 3D Principal Component plots for each combination of meaningful components}
\item{When Group != NULL, 2D and 3D Princiapl Component plots with convex hulls overlaid}
\item{2D or 3D graphics showing Principal Component shape variation for each meaningful component}
}

When analyzing bilateral symmetry, both the symmetric and asymmetric shape components undergo
separate clustering and PCA analyses. This enables detailed investigation of patterns
in both the shared (symmetric) and unique (asymmetric) aspects of shape variation.
The function generates comprehensive visualization plots for both components.

For shape data with semilandmarks, the function automatically handles sliding while
maintaining correct geometric relationships. Curve definitions must be provided to
enable proper sliding along curves as argument (curves). The sliding process
minimizes either bending energy or Procrustes distances based on the selected criterion.

Cluster analysis results are organized in the "GMA Results" folder directory,
Interactive visualization plots are stored in function output but can saved to
the directory by using the \code{saveWidget} function. GMA supports parallel processing
to optimize computational efficiency for large datasets as well as prints function
progress.
