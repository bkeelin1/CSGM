\description{
The Corpus_Land dataset consists of an p x k x n (landmarks, dimensions, individuals)
3D landmark array of 50 recent modern humans and 590 semilandmarks which map
the internal and external cortical bone surface of five crossâ€“sections taken
along the mandibular corpus: (1) the left side first and second intermolar
corpus (abbreviated as LM1-M2), (2) the left side third and fourth interpremolar
corpus (abbreviated as LP3-P4), (3) the mandibular symphysis, (4) the right
side third and fourth interpremolar corpus (abbreviated as RP3-P4), and (5)
the right side first and second intermolar corpus (abbreviated as RM1-M2).
For each cross-section, 119 equidistant semilandmarks were collected using
six of the semilandmarks as anchor points: (1) external buccal alveolar shelf,
(2) external basal corpus, (3) external lingual alveolar shelf, (4) internal
buccal alveolar shelf, (5) internal basal corpus, (6) internal lingual alveolar
shelf. When including the anchor points and semilandmarks together, the external
and internal cross-sectional contours contain 60 semilandmarks each and 30 semilandmarks
for the buccal and lingual sides.

\details{
The landmarks are organized sequentially by cross-section:
\itemize{
\item{LM1M2 (1-118):   Left first-second molar junction}
\item{LP3P4 (119-236):   Left third-fourth premolar junction}
\item{Symphysis (237-354):   Mandibular symphysis}
\item{RP3P4 (355-472):   Right third-fourth premolar junction}
\item{RM1M2 (473-590):   Right first-second molar junction}
}
