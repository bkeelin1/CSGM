\title{Multivariate Coefficient of Determination (R^2) Calculation}
\usage{
m_R2(observed, predicted)
}
\arguments{
\item{observed}{Matrix of observed values}

\item{predicted}{Matrix of predicted values}
}
\value{
a numeric value containing the coefficient of determination
}
\description{
Calculates appropriate R2 based on data characteristics:
\enumerate{
\item Correlation-based R2 for PCA/ranked data
\item Regularized trace-based R2 with Ledoit-Wolf shrinkage
\item Pillai's Trace-based R2 for multivariate data
\item Determinant based approach
\item Pseudo (Eigen) determinant R2 for multivariate data
\item Averaged R2
}
}
\details{
A function to calculate the coefficient of determination for multivariate
data. This function conducts all six methodologies for different multivariate
data contexts, normalizes negative R2 (poor fits for the multivariate data) and
finds the maximum R2 that is between 0 and 1. If no result is found (poor model
performance), 0 is selected.
