\arguments{
\item{Models}{Nested list object containing regression hypotheses to test. Each list element should
contain Response and Predictor data, structured as:

\itemize{
\item 'Hypothesis Test Models' # Argument Models object name
\itemize{
\item 'Symphyseal shape ~ Posterior Corpus Properties' --- 1st hypothesis model
\itemize{
\item 'Symphyseal shape ~ LM1-M2 Corpus Properties ' --- 1st hypothesis test
\itemize{
\item Symphyseal Landmarks --- Response Data within hypothesis test
\item LM1-M2 Corpus Properties --- Predictor data within hypothesis test
\item dt_parameters --- Optional data transformation parameters
}
\item 'Symphyseal shape ~ LP3-P4 Corpus Properties ' --- 2nd hypothesis test
\itemize{
\item Symphyseal Landmarks --- Response Data within hypothesis test
\item LP3-P4 Corpus Properties --- Predictor data within hypothesis test
\item dt_parameters --- Optional data transformation parameters

\itemize{
\item Symphyseal Landmarks --- Response Data within hypothesis test
\item RP3-P4 Corpus Properties --- Predictor data within hypothesis test
\item dt_parameters --- Optional data transformation parameters
}

\item Posterior Corpus Properties --- Predictor data within hypothesis test
\item dt_parameters --- Optional data transformation parameters
}
}
\item ..... --- 3rd hypothesis model
}
}}

\item{paired_subsets}{a logical value indicating whether or not the function
should iterate through regressions for every possible combination of subsets.
If argument paired_subsets = TRUE and argument point_set is not NULL, then
the function will calculate all of the possible subset combinations between
the response and predictor variables and conduct separate regressions for
each subsetted combination.}

\item{point_set}{Optional nested list specifying variable subsets to analyze. Structure must
match Models argument with added subset definitions:
\itemize{
\item point_set
\itemize{
\item Model_1 # Argument object name
\itemize{
\item Response               # Response list subsets (e.g., landmarks)
\itemize{
\item Subset_1 = c(1:20)    # Landmarks 1-20
\item Subset_2 = c(21:40)   # Landmarks 21-40
\item Subset_3 = c(41:60)   # Landmarks 41-60
}
\item Predictor              # Predictor subsets (e.g., data table)
\itemize{
\item Subset_1 = c(1:5)     # Variables 1-5
\item Subset_2 = c(6:10)    # Variables 6-10
\item Subset_3 = c(11:15)   # Variables 11-15
}
}
}
}

Each subset should be a numeric vector specifying which landmarks/variables to include.
Subsets can be of different sizes and overlap. When paired_subsets=TRUE, all
possible combinations of response and predictor subsets will be analyzed.}

\item{all_vips}{Optional nested list object containing variables of interest to trim the predictor dataset.
The structure should follow a similar structure to the  point_set argument where
for each m hypothesis model, there are i hypothesis tests. Within each hypothesis
test should be a vector called "vip" of variables to include in the analysis.
\itemize{
\item all_vips
\itemize{
\item Model_1 (1st hypothesis model)
\itemize{
\item Test_1 = c("var1", "var2", "var3", ...) # Variables for 1st test
\item Test_2 = c("var1", "var4", "var8", ...) # Variables for 2nd test
\item ... # More tests
}
\item Model_2 (2nd hypothesis model)
\itemize{
\item Test_1 = c("var2", "var5", "var9", ...) # Variables for 1st test
\item ... # More tests
}
\item ... # More models
}
}}

\item{subset_vips}{Optional nested list object containing variables for each subset within hypothesis tests.
The structure should follow a similar structure to the  point_set argument where
for each m hypothesis model, there are i hypothesis tests. Within each hypothesis
test should be j list objects of character or numeric vectors called "vip" to
include in the analysis for each subset.
\itemize{
\item subset_vips
\itemize{
\item Model_1 (1st hypothesis model)
\itemize{
\item Test_1 (1st hypothesis test)
\itemize{
\item Subset_1 = c("var1", "var2", ...) # Variables for subset 1

\item ... # More subsets
}
\item Test_2 (2nd hypothesis test)
\itemize{
\item Subset_1 = c("var2", "var4", ...) # Variables for subset 1
\item ... # More subsets
}
\item ... # More tests
}
\item Model_2 (2nd hypothesis model)
\itemize{
\item ... # Similar structure
}
\item ... # More models
}
}}

\item{key}{Character string. Identifier for output files and directories. Default is NULL.}
}
\value{
Returns a nested list containing:
\itemize{
\item{Model_1:   First Hypothesis Model
\itemize{ First Test within first Hypothesis Model
\item{ANOVA tables         Contains SS, MS, Rsq, F, Z, and P-values}
\item{Effect size          R-squared values for each model}

\description{
This function conducts, in parallel, a Procrustes linear regression
on multiple models between landmark arrays (Response variable) and predictor
variables (univariate or multivariate). The function was designed to aid in
studies where multiple regression hypotheses need to be tested on different
and/or the same predictor variables. This function permits conducting regressions
on subsets or combinations of subsetted landmarks and/or variables.
}
\details{
The PSLR function performs Procrustes shape linear regression analysis by:
\enumerate{
\item Creating working directories for results storage
\item Processing multiple regression models in parallel
\item Handling data transformations (PCA, Procrustes distances, etc.)
\item Supporting subset analysis of landmarks and variables
\item Implementing paired comparisons when requested
\item Managing error handling and alternative approaches
\item Writing results to Excel in summarized format
}

The function uses geomorph::procD.lm() for the regression analysis with:
\itemize{
\item Parallel processing enabled
\item 1000 iterations
\item Randomized residual permutation procedure (RRPP)
}
}

# Scenario Question: How much of symphyseal shape variance can be explained

# LM1M2 - interdental junction of the left side first and second molars.
# LP3P4 - interdental junction of the left side third and fourth premolars.
# RP3P4 - interdental junction of the right side third and fourth premolars.
# RM1M2 - interdental junction of the right side first and second molars.
